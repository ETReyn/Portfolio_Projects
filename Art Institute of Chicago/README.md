This is a command line program that allows a user to view many of the works in the Chicago Institute of Art's gallery. To use this program, you must first
create a database called 'artwork', this is where all the Chicago Institute of Art's data will be held. There is an sql script called artwork.sql which will 
create this database. Once the script is run, a user can then use the rest of the program.
